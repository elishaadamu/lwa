By [Christopher Allen](/lwa/about)

I decided after years of reading blogs that it was time to start blogging.

Why Blogger? I wanted an easy web interface, but also I wanted it hosted on my site (which is [Debian](http://www.debian.org) based). A couple of blog tools offer this. I wanted something really simple and I didn't want to host my own tools (keeping my own TWiki's up-to-date has been a pain) so I wanted the tools hosted elsewere. I also required that the remote tools used a secure connection to my server -- Blogger uses SFTP.

But the clincher was the new [Google Toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/).

My only SNAFU so far is that I've got my new [Kitchen TWiki](http://twiki.alacritymanagement.com/bin/view/Kitchen) working to send and receive RSS, however, the signup for [Blogger Pro](http://pro.blogger.com/) has the note "Blogger Pro ordering is currently offline while we retool. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please check back next week."
