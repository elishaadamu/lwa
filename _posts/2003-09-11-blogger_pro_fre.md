By [Christopher Allen](/about)

I have been hesitating on committing to [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) because ever time I check into availability of Blogger Pro, it was not available. Apparently now [Blogger Pro is Free](http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/pro_email.pyra).

My remaining concern is that the [new feature list](http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/announcement.pyra) for Blogger Pro does not mention RSS syndication at all, nor does it mention if it will be available in the future. There is a help item for for Syndication, however, it refers to a "Site Feed" tab on my settings panel, and that item is not available.

If RSS syndication is not available soon, I will likely switch to some other software, in spite of the ease of Blogger Pro.
