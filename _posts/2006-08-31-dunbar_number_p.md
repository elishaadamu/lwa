Sketch by Dave GrayLast May I did an abbreviated version of my Dunbar Number talk at MeshForum 2006. A MP3 podcast of that talk is now available at IT Conversations  or can be downloaded here (10mb).

If you'd like to follow along, here is a pdf copy of my presentation sides (10mb).

Biggest addition to what I've written about before is some discussion about different kinds of social software and what what size groups they seem to be appropriate for.

Some other posts about the Dunbar Number and group size issues:

2004-03: The Dunbar Number as a Limit to Group Sizes (also some really good comments)
2005-02: Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections
2005-03: Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation
2005-07: Cheers: Belongingness and Para-Social Relationships
2005-08: Dunbar & World of Warcraft
