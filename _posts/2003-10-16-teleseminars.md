[Stuart Henshall](http://www.henshall.com/blog/) has been investigating for a while the use of converencing software ([iChat](http://www.apple.com/ichat/), [Skype](http://www.skpe.com), etc.) for use with business. I thought this advertisement was a datapoint toward his proposition that this area will become more important. Basically _[How to Get Your Permission Email Past Filters: New Handbook + Q&A Teleseminar](http://www.sherpastore.com/store/page.cfm/p.cfm/2094?1040)_ is a .pdf book at one price, or a .pdf and a "teleseminar" at another price.
