[The Social Software Weblog](http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/6674682935746669/) discusses [DragonVenture Invests in Social Networking Platform in China](http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=61083):

> "If you think Friendster was slow with four million members imagine if a tens of millions, or hundreds of millions, of the two billion people in China join eFriendsnet.com! Why hasn't Friendster or Tribe.net launched international sites?!"

This reminds of a quote I heard this last weekend from Tom Melcher, former CNET exec, and who has [recently left](http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,60960,00.html) [There](http://www.there.com) to live and work in China:

> There are now more people in China on the Internet then there are members of the Chinese Communist Party.

I wonder how well explicit social networks will take off in China, given a history of repression and recent censoring of the Internet. I could see it easily becoming a tool that could be abused by their government.
