This blog has been quiet lately as I've been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I've been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (presentation, video from panel), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development (first two chapters free), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming iPhoneDevCamp 2, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.

I've been reluctant to post too many of these off posts on this blog, as I like the length, quality and high-signal-to-noise ratio of the posts that I've written for this blog. I do plan to continue to offer more social software and social media posts, including followups to my Collective Choice articles, as well as updates on my popular Dunbar Number posts. But I don't want to spam my readers here with notes on iPhone Apps, my thoughts on movies, circuses, the odd conferences I speak at, etc.

EphemerablogthumbSo I've been trying to figure out how to cover some of the other things that I am up to without loosing my readers here, so decided to a create a new blog for my shorter and more transitory thoughts: Christopher Allen's Ephemera Blog. So far I have posted:

Max 9 pages, thus Max 144 Apps on iPhone OS 2.0
First Look at AirMe App for iPhone
Trying Out TypePad's Blog It Web App
iPhone TypePad App Second Pass
iPhone TypePad App First Look
Ephemera Blog
The RSS feed for this blog is here .

If you are interested in some of the other things I am looking at, you can follow my del.icio.us bookmarks, or read my Google Shared Items, watch my Twitter posts, or see them all combined together in either FriendFeed or Plaxo Pulse.
