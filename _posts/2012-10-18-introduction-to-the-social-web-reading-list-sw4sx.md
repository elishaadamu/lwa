These are the initial required readings for the first two weeks of my Using the Social Web for Social Change class (hashtag #SW4SX) that I teach in the MBA in Sustainable Systems program at Bainbridge Graduate Institute.

The goal of this portion of the class is to cover an introduction and overview of the landscape of the Social Web, establish among the students the beginning of a shared language about the medium, and introduce a process toward a collaborative culture that we will use for the rest of the course. Students are also kicking off their Beat blogs on sustainability topics, with the goal of helping them move toward having an authentic online voice.

TOPIC: New Ways of Learning

When I designed this class four years ago, I was inspired by Michael Wesch's class at Kansas State University. This is a shared artifact created by his class that I use to set the stage for my own students.

KEYQUOTE: “This video was created by me and the 200 students enrolled in ANTH 200: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology at Kansas State University, Spring 2007. It began as a brainstorming exercise, thinking about how students learn, what they need to learn for their future, and how our current educational system fits in.”
TOPIC: Shared Language

Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.

KEYQUOTE: “Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something…However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact…It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: "Is this what you mean when…"

ARTICLE: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1659772,00.html
KEYQUOTE: "Why don't people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other's brains. People are very, very touchy about their relationships. Whenever you speak to someone, you are presuming the two of you have a certain degree of familiarity--which your words might alter. So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship."
Kim, Eugene Eric "Developing Shared Language" eeKim.com, 2006-06-09
BLOG: http://eekim.com/blog/2006/06/developing-shared-language/
KEYQUOTE: "Shared Language is a prerequisite to collaboration. Without Shared Language, we can’t collaborate. It’s as simple as that. When a group tries to collaborate without having Shared Language, the group will try to create it, whether it’s aware of it or not. This creation process is often frustrating and painful, and as a result, people sometimes try to skip this step or belittle the process. This is a problem. You can’t skip this step."
TOPIC: Introduction to the Social Web

So what is the Social Web? It is Social Networks of people having conversations; Who are sharing Social Media; It functions using Social Software applications; And takes advantage of the toolchest of open technologies called Web 2.0.

TRANSCRIPT: http://www.ideasproject.com/transcript.webui?id=4538
(ABSTRACT:http://www.ideasproject.com/idea_person.webui?id=4537 )
KEYQUOTE: "The big trend I'm seeing in the future of communications is actually using the social network to share, to be more productive in the work environment, and to do more expression, organizing, creativity, in social and civic context. We're just in the early stages of the enabling technology to make that happen, how to make that happen technically, and how to make it happen socially so that we can use our social networks and use our groups as a foundation for doing really interesting, productive, and creative things."
SUB-TOPIC: Social Web - Social Media

What is Social Media: The online technologies and practices that people use to share opinions, insights, experiences, and perspectives with each other.

Qualman, Erik “Social Media Revolution 2 (refresh)”, YouTube, 2010-05-27
VIDEO: http://youtu.be/omSKo1OW6CU
ABSTRACT: “Social Media Revolution 2 is a refresh of the original video with new and updated social media & mobile statistics that are hard to ignore. Based on the book Socialnomics by Erik Qualman.”
Shirky, Clay "How Social Media can Make History", TEDed 2009-06
VIDEO: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/clay-shirky-how-social-media-can-make-history
ABSTRACT: "While news from Iran streams to the world, Clay Shirky shows how Facebook, Twitter and TXTs help citizens in repressive regimes to report on real news, bypassing censors (however briefly). The end of top-down control of news is changing the nature of politics."
SUB-TOPIC: Social Web - Social Software

What is Social Software? Software that supports, extends, or derives value from human social behavior.

Allen, Christopher "Tracing the Evolution of Social Software." Life With Alacrity. 13 Oct 2004
BLOGPOST: /2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html
KEYQUOTE: "The term 'social software', which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush's ideas about 'memex' in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. By examining the many terms used to describe today's 'social software' we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology."
SUB-TOPIC: Social Web - Web 2.0

So what is Web 2.0? The technology and web design to enhance creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users

QUOTE: "Social media has become an integral part of modern society. There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries. There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there. There are sites to share photos, videos, status updates, sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends. It seems there are social solutions to just about every need. In this article, we’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day."

SUB-TOPIC: Best Practices — Passwords

Allen, Christopher "Password Best Practices" Life With Alacrity, 2009-09-25
BLOGPOST: /2009/09/password-best-practices.html
KEYQUOTE: "Be Safe: None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a phishing attack."

ARTICLE:http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/24/technology/circuits/24mess.html
KEYQUOTE: "But others are genuinely interested in a lecturer's topic and want to talk concurrently about what is being said. They may also like to pass around links to Web sites that relate to, and may refute, a speaker's point. For them, wireless technology allows a back channel of communication, a second track that reveals their thoughts and feedback and records it all for future reference."

KEYQUOTE: "Companies cannot survive (let alone prosper) without recognizing that Social as a phenomenon can allow us to redefine our organizations to be inherently more fast fluid and flexible by its very design. Not by doing a little bit more, or slimming down a bit here or there, or by doing a few things a little bit faster. No. We will not tweak our way into the future."

KEYQUOTE: "What we're dealing with now is not the problem of information overload, because we're always dealing (and always have been dealing) with information overload...Thinking about information overload isn't accurately describing the problem; thinking about filter failure is."

ARTICLE: http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-networks/social-media-pretend-friends-and-the-lie-of-false-intimacy/
KEYQUOTE: “Fundamentally, technology and our use of it isn’t – as we’ve all hoped – bringing us closer together. In fact, it may be driving us farther apart, as we know more and more people, but know less and less about each of them.”
Richtel, Matt "Attached to Technology and Paying a Price: Your Brain on Computers" New York Times, 2010-06-10
ARTICLE: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html
SINGLEPAGE: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all
KEYQUOTE: " Scientists say juggling e-mail, phone calls and other incoming information can change how people think and behave. They say our ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information. These play to a primitive impulse to respond to immediate opportunities and threats. The stimulation provokes excitement — a dopamine squirt — that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence, people feel bored."
SUB-TOPIC: The Dark Side: Privacy

Shirky, Clay "Facebook Killed the Private Life" Switched, 2007-11-06
VIDEO: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azIW1xjSTCo

BLOGPOST:/2004/04/four_kinds_of_p.html
KEYQUOTE: "My thoughts have now gelled sufficiently to make some observations about privacy. When people speak about privacy, they may actually be talking about very different forms of privacy: defensive privacy, human-rights privacy, personal privacy, and contextual privacy."

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Privacy-management-on-social-media/Summary-of-findings.aspx
KEYQUOTE: "Social media users who are college graduates are significantly more likely than those with lower levels of education to say that they experience some difficulty in managing the privacy controls on their profiles. … 11% of SNS users have posted content they regret."
Consumer Reports "Facebook & your privacy — Who sees the data you share on the biggest social network?" Consumer Reports Magazone, 2012-06
ARTICLE: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/06/facebook-your-privacy/index.htm
ABSTRACT: "How much information is really being collected about you? How is it being used? And could it fall into the wrong hands? To find out, we queried Facebook and interviewed some two dozen others, including security experts, privacy lawyers, app developers, and victims of security and privacy abuse. We dug into private, academic, and government research, as well as Facebook’s labyrinthian policies and controls. And we surveyed 2,002 online households, including 1,340 that are active on Facebook, for our annual State of the Net report. We then projected those data to estimate national totals."
Thompson, Clive "Brave New World of Digital Intimacy" New York Times, 2008-09-07
ARTICLE: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html
(SINGLEPAGE: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all )
KEYQUOTE: "It is easy to become unsettled by privacy-eroding aspects of awareness tools. But there is another — quite different — result of all this incessant updating: a culture of people who know much more about themselves. Many of the avid Twitterers, Flickrers and Facebook users I interviewed described an unexpected side-effect of constant self-disclosure. The act of stopping several times a day to observe what you’re feeling or thinking can become, after weeks and weeks, a sort of philosophical act. It’s like the Greek dictum to “know thyself,” or the therapeutic concept of mindfulness. (Indeed, the question that floats eternally at the top of Twitter’s Web site — “What are you doing?” — can come to seem existentially freighted. What are you doing?) Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they’re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form."

KEYQUOTE: "Think about how the trendy, jargon, national, and regional references you use in your blog may be misunderstood or even confuse your blog readers. It’s critical for bloggers to be “understood”, so take time to look at what you write and how your writing may create a disconnect with your readers."
Finney, Hal "Writing for the Future" extropy-chat 2004-11-19
BLOGPOST: http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2004-November/011224.html
KEYQUOTE: "One thing we should keep in mind when writing here or in any online forum is that we are writing not only for the present, but for the future. Our words may well be read many times, even far into the future. They are recorded in public and private archives and will be available indefinitely. Given the likely increase in future levels of intelligence and attention, it may even turn out that more eyes see our writings in the far future than in the near present."
I welcome your thoughts for additional or replacement Social Web introductory readings that we can use in the next class in the Spring of 2013.
