## Converting to TypePad Complete

January 30 2004 - 100 Words

by Christopher Allen

For the last few weeks I've been moving my blog from Blogger Pro over to the TypePad service, after a frustrating try to get WordPress to work. While I was at it, I moved my blog from my business server to this new domain.

I finally have it all working here now, but all of my old permalinks are broken. In progress is a utility that will redirect people from the old permalinks to the new. I'll report progress on that later.
