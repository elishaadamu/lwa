I'm fascinated by the melding of various ethic music styles with contemporary music, in particular, when the mix includes some middle-eastern or central-european infuences.

For instance, listen to these:

A mix of rock and middle-eastern: Too Tight by Falik on their album Streaks and Strokes
(stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" MagnaTune).
Turkish Pop and Dylan lyrics: One More Cup of Coffee (sample only), by Sertab Erener.
A mix of electronica and middle-eastern: Desert Journey by Solace on their album Vadalna.
(stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" MagnaTune).
A mix of electronica and south asia (india): Sair (Trip) by Solace on their album Satya
(stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" MagnaTune).
A mix of rock & celtic, with central-european accents: Liquid Silver by Beth Quist on her album Silver
(stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" MagnaTune).
Not quite sure how to categorize it -- a real ethnic mongrel: Ethnosphere by Shiva in Exile on their album Ethnic.
(stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" MagnaTune).
