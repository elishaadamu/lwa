I have been hesitating on committing to Blogger because ever time I check into availability of Blogger Pro, it was not available. Apparently now Blogger Pro is Free.

My remaining concern is that the new feature list for Blogger Pro does not mention RSS syndication at all, nor does it mention if it will be available in the future. There is a help item for for Syndication, however, it refers to a "Site Feed" tab on my settings panel, and that item is not available.

If RSS syndication is not available soon, I will likely switch to some other software, in spite of the ease of Blogger Pro.
