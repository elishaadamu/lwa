Blog-action-day-food-500x250Today is Blog Action Day, where each year a topic is chosen and bloggers and activists worldwide write about that topic in their blogs or post about it on Twitter and Facebook using the tags #FOOD and #BAD11.

This year's topic is Food, and this year many of my students of my BGIedu class Using the Social Web for Social Change are using the day to help kick off their "Beat Blog" assignments. The goal of Beat Blogs is for each student to choose a topic they are passionate about and blog about it at least weekly for two and a half months. Many students decide to keep their blogs going afterwards, am I'm always tickled when that happens.

Some of the blog posts by my students on the topic of Food:

Make a Connection for Blog Action Day (from Building Stronger Communities Through Sustainable Agriculture, a blog on sustainable agriculture)
