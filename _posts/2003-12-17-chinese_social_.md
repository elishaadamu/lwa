The Social Software Weblog discusses DragonVenture Invests in Social Networking Platform in China:

"If you think Friendster was slow with four million members imagine if a tens of millions, or hundreds of millions, of the two billion people in China join eFriendsnet.com! Why hasn't Friendster or Tribe.net launched international sites?!"
This reminds of a quote I heard this last weekend from Tom Melcher, former CNET exec, and who has recently left There to live and work in China:
There are now more people in China on the Internet then there are members of the Chinese Communist Party.
I wonder how well explicit social networks will take off in China, given a history of repression and recent censoring of the Internet. I could see it easily becoming a tool that could be abused by their government.
