I'm fascinated by the melding of various ethic music styles with contemporary music, in particular, when the mix includes some middle-eastern or central-european infuences.

For instance, listen to these:

* A mix of rock and middle-eastern: [Too Tight](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/01%20-%20Too%20tight%20-%20Falik.mp3) by [Falik](https://web.archive.org/web/20060102010648/http://www.magnatune.com/artists/falik) on their album [Streaks and Strokes](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/01%20-%20Too%20tight%20-%20Falik.mp3)  
    (stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" [MagnaTune](http://www.magnatune.com)).
    
* Turkish Pop and Dylan lyrics: [One More Cup of Coffee](https://web.archive.org/web/20060806034134/http://www.musto-gusto.us/Samples/CD157/05%20-%20One%20more%20cup%20of%20coffee.mp3?ABCDEFGH) (sample only), by [Sertab Erener](http://www.sertab.net/2002/homepagee.htm).
    
* A mix of electronica and middle-eastern: [Desert Journey](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/02%20-%20Desert%20Journey%20-%20Solace.mp3) by [Solace](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/02%20-%20Desert%20Journey%20-%20Solace.mp3) on their album [Vadalna](https://web.archive.org/web/20060325021613/http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/solace-vadalna/).  
    (stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" [MagnaTune](http://www.magnatune.com)).
    
* A mix of electronica and south asia (india): [Sair (Trip)](https://web.archive.org/web/20060320152309/http://www.magnatune.com/artists/albums/solace-vadalna/hifi.m3u) by [Solace](http://www.magnatune.com/artists/solace) on their album [Satya](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603145133/http://www.magnatune.com/artists/music/World/Solace/Satya/)  
    (stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" [MagnaTune](http://www.magnatune.com)).
    
* A mix of rock & celtic, with central-european accents: [Liquid Silver](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/01%20-%20Liquid%20Silver%20-%20Beth%20Quist.mp3) by [Beth Quist](http://www.magnatune.com/artists/beth_quist) on her album [Silver](http://www.magnatune.com/artists/music/Rock/Beth%20Quist/Silver/)  
    (stream complements of by the "We are not Evil" [MagnaTune](http://www.magnatune.com)).
    
* Not quite sure how to categorize it -- a real ethnic mongrel: [Ethnosphere](http://he1.magnatune.com/all/11%20-%20Ethnosphere%20-%20Shiva%20In%20Exile.mp3) by [Shiva in Exile](http://www.magnatune.com/artists/shiva_in_exile) on their album [Ethnic](http://www.magnatune.com/artists/music/World/Shiva%20in%20Exile/Ethnic/).
