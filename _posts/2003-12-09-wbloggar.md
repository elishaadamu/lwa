[Stuart Henshal](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205095807/http://www.henshall.com/blog/) recommended that I try out [w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) for creating blog posts. I'm giving it a try here.

So far seems interesting -- in addition to spell checking and handling some html related tasks, it appears to also have the ability to work with various plugins, for instance, a Windows Media Player plugin to display what music I'm playing right now.

Stuart says that one of his favorite features is that the tool will post to multiple blogs at once, which is useful if you are maintaining a business and a non-business blog and yet some items will go into both.
