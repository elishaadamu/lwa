I've been working today on understand the [Design Pattern Language](http://www.designmatrix.com/pl/index.html) behind the Wiki concept. I've been making some postings at the Meatball Wiki site on this topic. These are the new topics that I have finished today.

* [Category of Wiki Design Patterns](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CategoryWikiDesignPatterns)
  
* [Pattern: Cheap and Easy Collaboration](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CheapAndEasyCollaboration)
  
* [Pattern: Simple Text Formatting](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SimpleTextFormatting)
  
* [Pattern: Character Formatting Rules](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CharacterFormattingRules)
  
* [Pattern: Paragraph Formatting Rules](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ParagraphFormattingRules)
  
* [Wiki Design Patterns Meta Commentary](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiDesignPatternsMetaCommentary)

I've also been doing a survey of the features of various versions of Wiki that have evolved over the years, and have started posting some of them at the bottom of the pattern documents.

More to come...
